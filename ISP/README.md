# Interface Segregation Principle
## Acronym
- S : Single Responsibility Principle ([SRP](SRP)).
- O : Open closed Principle ([OCP](OCP)).
- L : Liskov substitution Principle ([LSP](LSP)).
- I : Interface Segregation Principle ([ISP](ISP)).
- D : Dependency Inversion Principle ([DIP](DIP)).

## Interface Segregation Principle:
1. Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
2. We should not enforce clients to implement interfaces that they don't use. Instead of creating one big interface we can break down it to smaller interfaces.
