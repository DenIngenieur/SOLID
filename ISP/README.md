# Acronym
- S : Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
- O : Open closed Principle (OSP).
- L : Liskov substitution Principle (LSP).
- I : Interface Segregation Principle (ISP).
- D : Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).

## Interface Segregation Principle:
1. Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
2. We should not enforce clients to implement interfaces that they don't use. Instead of creating one big interface we can break down it to smaller interfaces.
