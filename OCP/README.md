# Open/Closed Principle:
1. Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
2. The design and writing of the code should be done in a way that new functionality should be added with minimum changes in the existing code.
3. The design should be done in a way to allow the adding of new functionality as new classes, keeping as much as possible existing code unchanged.
